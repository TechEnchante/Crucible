🔥 Crucible — Git for Life

> “After being impacted by a RIF, I found myself disoriented—no roadmap, no daily standups, no sprint goals. Just silence.”

**Crucible** was born in that silence.

It’s not just an app. It’s a way to rebuild your sense of momentum — one commit, one quest at a time.

Crucible fuses **Git-style structure** with **RuneScape-style quests**.  
Track your life with commits. Generate real-world quests with AI. Store your progress semantically.

## ❓ What is Crucible?

- ✅ Git‑like commits for real-world tasks and achievements  
- 🧠 AI‑powered quests shaped by your history and environment  
- 📦 Qdrant vector storage for semantic memory & retrieval  
- 🔮 Optional runes and world events to guide focus and intent  

Turn confusion into clarity.  
Burnout into XP.  
Every day into a step toward purpose.

> This is your forge.  
> This is your **Crucible**.

## 📐 Architecture

```
[React UI] <---> [FastAPI API] <---> [Qdrant DB]
                               |
                          [OpenAI API]
```

- Commits = vectors + metadata  
- Quests = templates + similarity search  
- Quest engine = embedding lookup → LLM prompt → custom quest

## 🧠 AI Quest Engine Flow

1. Embed last N commits with `all-mpnet-base-v2`
2. Search Qdrant for related quest/event templates
3. Prompt LLM:
    ```
    Given these commits: ...
    And these signals: ["Rainy weather", "Hackathon today"]
    Draft a quest that fits context and goals.
    ```
4. Output:

```json
{
  "quest_id": "xyz",
  "title": "Forge Your First Public Release",
  "description": "You've logged 5 'bugfix' commits—now package version 1.0 and share it!",
  "xp_reward": 100
}
```
